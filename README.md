Notes.vim
=========
Hack-A-Week 5: A folding file for my notes, written in vimscript.

### Features
- Allows vim to fold notes for easier navigation and readability

### What it does
- Sets fold to expr
- Provides a framework to structure notes in for repeatability and readibility

### What it doesn't do
- Account for different notation styles

### Reasons for not doing things
- I want there to be only one way to structure notes, for future readability.
- "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it" -Zen of Python

### Example

### Unfolded

### Partially Folded

### Fully Folded
